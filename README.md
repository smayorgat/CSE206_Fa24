The grade in this class will be determined by the **final exam** (30%), a **midterm test** (30%),
two **partial tests** (15% each), and **two quizzes** (5% each).

The two quizzes will _not_ be announced beforehand and will take place during the last 10-15 minutes of *some* of the tutorial sessions. 
Each quiz will consist of one question on a topic from the same session. 
The exact dates for the quizzes will be secret.

1. August 29th: Introduction.
2. September 5th: Data statistics.
3. September 12th: Events, probability, conditional probability and Bayes' formula.
