<li> <i>Textbook</i>: I will use a mix of sources. Some times I will have my own personal notes. In English, you can read:
  <ul> 
    <li> Gnedenko, Khinchin: "An elementary introduction to the theory of probability". </li>
    <li> Walpole, Myers, Myers, Ye: "Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists".  </li>
  </ul>
  In Russian you can read:
  <ul>
    <li> Б. В. Гнеденко, А. Я. Хинчим, "Элементарное введение в теорию вероятностей".</li>
    <li> Е. А. Трофимова, Н. В. Кисляк, Д. В. Гилёв, "Теория вероятностей и математическая статистика" (учебное пособие). </li>
  </ul>

The grade in this class will be determined by the **final exam** (30%), a **midterm test** (30%),
two **partial tests** (15% each), and **two quizzes** (5% each).

The two quizzes will _not_ be announced beforehand and will take place during the last 10-15 minutes of *some* of the tutorial sessions. 
Each quiz will consist of one question on a topic from the same session. 
The exact dates for the quizzes will be secret.

Everything else is scheduled:
1. August 29th: Introduction to the course. Data statistics.
2. September 5th: Events, probability, conditional probability and Bayes' formula.
3. September 12th: Random variables and probability distributions.
4. September 19th: Mean, variance, covariance and Chebyshev's inequality.
5. <ins>September 26th</ins>:  Binomial and multinomial distributions. **Partial test** on
topics 1 through 4 *during tutorial time*.
6. October 3rd:  Hypergeometric distribution.
7. October 10th: Poisson distribution and process.
8. <ins>October 17th</ins>: **Midterm test** during lecture time, covering topics 1 through 7. We will have a 
discussion during tutorial time.
9. October 24th: Continuous probability distributions (I).
10. October 31th: Continuous probability distributions (II).
11. November 7th: Sampling distribution of means and the central limit theorem.
12. <ins>November 14th</ins>: t-Distribution, F-Distribution, Quantile and Probability Plots.
**Partial test** during the recitation following this lecture, on topics 9 through 11.
13. November 21th: Elementary estimation theory.
14. November 28th: Elementary hypothesis testing.
15. December 5th: Elementary linear regression.

<ins>The **final exam**</ins> will take place during the final exam week.
