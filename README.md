<li> <i>Office hours</i>: Saturdays 9 am - 11 am in office 411 A. </li>
<li> <i>Textbook</i>: I will use a mix of sources. Some times I will have my own personal notes. In English, you can read:
  <ul> 
    <li> Gnedenko, Khinchin: "An elementary introduction to the theory of probability". </li>
    <li> Walpole, Myers, Myers, Ye: "Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists".  </li>
  </ul>
  In Russian you can read:
  <ul>
    <li> Б. В. Гнеденко, А. Я. Хинчим, "Элементарное введение в теорию вероятностей".</li>
    <li> Е. А. Трофимова, Н. В. Кисляк, Д. В. Гилёв, "Теория вероятностей и математическая статистика" (учебное пособие). </li>
  </ul>

The grade in this class will be determined by the **final exam** (30%), a **midterm test** (30%),
two **partial tests** (15% each), and **two quizzes** (5% each).

The two quizzes will _not_ be announced beforehand and will take place during the last 10-15 minutes of *some* of the tutorial sessions. 
Each quiz will consist of one question on a topic from the same session. 
The exact dates for the quizzes will be secret.

If your final score is _x_, then

* you get an A if _x_ ≥ 87,
* you get a B if 87 > _x_ ≥ 70,
* you get a C if 70 > _x_ ≥ 55,
* you get a D if 55 > _x_ ≥ -∞.
